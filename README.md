The R script, run_analysis.R will accomplish the following tasks:

1. Loading train and test dataset into R, adding subject&activity info, and merging the two datasets
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Namning the activities in the dataset using descriptive activity_labels
4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
